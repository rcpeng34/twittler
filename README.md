This is a copy of the work I did on a private repo, originally a project from
[Hack Reactor's](http://hackreactor.com) curriculum. This project was worked
on in a short sprint as a side project while working full time client hours; 
it's representative of the kind of problems that I've tackled prior to starting Hack Reactor.
